Starting with this project I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I wanted to keep it simple and somewhat easy since I'm a beginner in all this but it turned out to be a nice, fun challenge. I decided to go with an 'Idea Bulletin Board' app where its simple enough of just posting ideas you have in the app. I took inspiration from multiple references I can find and the example projects that Flatiron has suggested to look at for help and I have to say I am pretty proud of how it looks with what I'm able to do right now with what I know. I want to continue with it and make it a nice looking Bulletin Board app but I don't have the time nor the expertise just yet to continue it but once I do I while. 

This has made me excited because I'm starting to see what ill be able to do with what I'm learning and what I will be doing with my career and I'm looking forward to it.
