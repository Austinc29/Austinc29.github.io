I hope everything works out with how this saves on learn, I couldn't find a separate icon to click on to create a new blog post so I just clicked the next one down. My CLI project was a "Starwars People Informer", It gave you a list of the ten characters the API I used had, and then a few attributes they had. 

It started well, I was using the walkthroughs and some other resources I found on google to help me and I got the CLI working well with the fake data. That was very exciting to see an interface that I typed up interacting with me, but trying to get the real data to work was a struggle. I wanted to scrape a website to possibly get some good descriptions about the characters but I couldn't find any that weren't to simple to where I could narrow it down funny enough. So I decided to use an API because all the data was already there and I just had to plug it into my code and it was less hair pulling then trying to do a good scrape.
