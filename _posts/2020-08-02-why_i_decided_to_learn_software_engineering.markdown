Growing up I've played games all the time. Even as a little 6 year old me and my dad would play games such as, Halo, Gears of War, Call of duty (when it came out), and even Resident Evil which my mom hated since there were some pretty scary zombies in that game. Even before those and the days of the Xbox, I played on the Gamecube, Playstation, Wii, Etc.. So I've grown to love games and everything that has to do with them. It wasn't until just recently that I realized how they're created, I don't know or remember how I thought they were built but a bunch of lines of code for everything in the game didn't come to mind. 

So after years of playing games on console and PC, I've got a familiarity with technology. My family always looks to me when something goes wrong with their phone or computers etc.. Now I'm not an IT guy but I've always seemed to figure it out which has built some confidence around technology. 

Before this pandemic happened and I found this course I was working at Walmart (which is not where you'd want to be working during a pandemic) and I decided I did not want to work there then so I started looking at jobs/careers I could do from home that wasn't that hard and Software Engineering was on every article I clicked on. I did some more research on it and watched a bunch of videos on what Software Engineers do and realized its something that I could do. I started getting excited about it and tried teaching myself with free courses but quickly realized I needed some structure that a course gives, so I looked into boot camps and which ones were the best and had better results and what offered more and decided on Flatiron because of their Job Guarantee and Money Back if no job was found within a certain amount of time. So I went through admissions and got into a Cohort and did as much as the boot camp prep as I could until my start date arrived last Monday. I have to say that I am equally as excited and nervous about the boot camp, but my excitement and high hopes for a good outcome and a good career is what pushes me and keeps me working hard.
